## First time locally

```sh
cp .env.example .env

npm run docker
npm run setup
npm run build
```

## Development

You do need to have the postgres database running.

```
npm run docker
```

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
